Bugs Identified:
**Incomplete Error Handling in useEffect:**
The useEffect that fetches products lacks proper error handling, and it doesn't set the loading state. If an error occurs during the fetch, the loading state will remain true, giving the user no indication that an error has occurred.
**Missing Product Descriptions:**
The product descriptions are missing from the rendered components.
**Hardcoded Maximum Products for Progress Bar:**
The progress bar width calculation is based on a hardcoded maximum number of products (50). This value should be dynamic or passed as a prop to the component.

Changes Made:
**Error Handling and Loading State:**
Added proper error handling in the useEffect for fetching products.
Set the loading state to false in the finally block to indicate that the fetch operation is complete.

**Include Product Descriptions:**
Added the missing product descriptions in the rendered components.
**Dynamic Maximum Products for Progress Bar:**
Dynamically calculate the maximum products for the progress bar based on the number of fetched products. This ensures that the progress bar is responsive to changes in the number of products.


REFACTORING OF CODE:
Changes Made:
Removed Unused State (user):

Removed the user state since it wasn't being utilized.
Improved Variable Naming:

Renamed progressBarWidth to calculateProgressBarWidth for clarity.
Simplified User Decoding:

Simplified the decoding of the user from the JWT token.
Consolidated Loading and Error States:

Consolidated the loading and error states into a single useEffect for fetching products. This avoids duplication and ensures consistent state management.
Improved Dynamic Maximum Products Calculation:

Simplified the calculation of the dynamic maximum products for the progress bar.
Removed Redundant useState Initialization:

Removed redundant initialization of useState for user, products, loading, and error. The initial values are null, [], true, and null, respectively, which are already set during state declaration.
